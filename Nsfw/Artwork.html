        <p>
            This artwork explores the unsettling contrast between appearance and reality. At first, it seems to depict a man, but when half of the face is concealed, Mother Teresa emerges—revealing a dual identity.
            The piece symbolizes the facade of virtue, where kindness may serve as a mask for something more complex, even sinister.
            Through this illusion, the drawing challenges the viewer to question the truth behind celebrated figures, suggesting that what we see is not always what truly exists.

            I'm exposing a group of oppressed people here. Nothing is going to change here with my picture but this is a reminder that this will happen to us tomorrow.
            Either we lose or we go backwards and you decide you can win and move on.....
            My answer to those who ask why all this is the same eye in the picture.
            No Matter how good we try, some will not agree.we call it society because this is India...this is India!
            In the past, when people were scared, we would seek the help of the law, but today is the time to be afraid of the law, so the time to be afraid of ourselves is not far off ........ Why?
            No one knows who is drowning in oppression The world knows who survived it so let us move forward together till the end of the road
            We may not see the tears of the oppressed but tomorrow it will happen to us too. so you can decide whether to respond or congratulate.

        <p>This drawing portrays the themes of heavy oppression and helpness faced by the Dalit community of India.

            The hands represents the systemic suppression - casteist discrimination,violence and silencing of voices.
            The wrinkles and scars etched into the face are the testament of their stories and endurance, while the eyes convey pain and resilience rising against the numerous hands that intend to restrain, 
            silence and suffocate the subject.</p>

            Thousands of images passed through his mind.
            Time to forget everything.
            He closed his eyes. That was when the image struck him, the most dreadful one- 'Sheets drenched in blood' ; Blood still warm, crying for help. 
            Tears rolled down his cheeks. He opened his eyes. The light of the dawn peeped through the cracks in the clouds. The river was still calm and the bridge was empty. 
            All the grief and anger clouding his senses parted and the past appeared to be more lucid than he thought it would be. But it was sort of cruel in a way. 
            What was the point of having a clear vision of life when it is about to end?
            A gentle breeze kissed him goodbye. He was ready to jump.

        This abstract drawing depicts the face of a young man, with deteriorating mental state caught vulnerable between the choices of holding on and letting go. The boy stands at the edge of a cliff. His eyes are heavy with sorrow. His thoughts are a tangled mess of grief, regret and memories . 
        His face,almost consumed by the shadows of the quiet night, looks  fragmented.  
        Yet nature refuses to leave him alone. The wind  carries the weight of his tears , granting him his final solace.
