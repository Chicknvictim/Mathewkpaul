        This is my first car model, completed in a couple of months. I handled the modeling and texturing in Maya and rendered it in Arnold, aiming for a realistic look.
         I used reference images to nail the details and experimented with different materials and lighting setups to capture the car’s true character.
         As I progressed, I learned how to refine everything from the smooth curves of the body to the reflective surfaces that give the model depth. 
         This project not only challenged me technically but also helped expand my knowledge of Maya and 3D design.
        Here are some renders taken from Arnold that showcase the journey and effort behind this model.
